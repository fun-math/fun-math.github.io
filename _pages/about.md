Hello! I am a doctoral student at [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/), [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Nishad Kothari](https://sites.google.com/view/nishadkothari/). 

My research interests lie in Graph Theory, in particular Structural Graph Theory. I am also broadly interested in Combinatorics, Algorithms and Discrete Maths. 

I completed my Bachelors and Masters degree in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), where I had the privilege to work under the supervison of the late [Ajit Diwan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~aad/). My Bachelors and Masters thesis was completed under the guidance of Prof. Nishad Kothari and Prof. Ajit Diwan. During my undergraduate studies, I had the fantastic opportunity to work with Prof. Swaprava Nath. Prior to that, i also visited TU Braunschweig, Germany to collaborate with Prof. Sandor Fekete.    

Previously, I have participated in International Astronomy Olympiad (IAO) in 2017 and International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in 2018. These days, I serve as resourse person in various math olympiad training camps including INMOTC and IMOTC where I am involved in teaching and evalutaion. 

Apart from academics, I am an avid adventurer. I am into mountaineering, rock climbing, paragliding and biking to name a few.
